    🎓 MPAgent Pool with IcoAsyncStream Demonstration

    This example shows how to use IcoAsyncStream for parallel processing with multiple
    MPAgent workers, enabling concurrent execution instead of sequential processing.

    📋 Key Features:

    1. **IcoAsyncStream**: Runs multiple MPAgent workers in parallel (not sequential)
    2. **Worker Differentiation**: Different workers have different iteration counts
    3. **Concurrent Processing**: Each input item is processed by ALL workers simultaneously
    4. **Independent Progress**: Each worker shows its own progress tracking

    🔄 Async vs Sequential Processing:
    - **Sequential .stream()**: item1→worker1→worker2, then item2→worker1→worker2
    - **IcoAsyncStream**: item1→(worker1 || worker2), item2→(worker1 || worker2)

    🏗️ Flow Architecture:
        numbers (source) → overall_progress → IcoAsyncStream([worker1, worker2]) → sink

    📊 Progress Tracking:
        - "Overall Progress": main flow progress (10 items)
        - "Worker 1": 5 iterations per item (faster completion)
        - "Worker 2": 10 iterations per item (slower completion)

    🎯 Real-world Use Case:
    Processing same data through different models or algorithms concurrently,
    like ensemble ML inference or A/B testing scenarios.
